# THE ENGINE ENVIRONMENT: the Python packages a render needs, installed into
# the engine venv (ltx-2-mlx/env). ONE implementation, three callers:
#   install.js        - Install / Resume Install / the sidebar Repair entry
#   the panel         - "Repair engine" (POST /engine/repair), which re-runs
#                       ONLY this step, no downloads, no venv rebuild
#   by hand           - bash scripts/pinokio/ltx_engine_env.sh
#
# WHY IT IS A SCRIPT NOW (4.17.4 fleet fix). `venv_broken` - "the engine venv
# has a Python but no packages" - on fresh installs, every version: 18
# installs in 30 days, nearly all at the very first boot. This step used to be
# install.js's inline message array, so nothing but Pinokio's /error:/i output
# match decided whether it had worked: the first transient network failure
# ended the whole Install, and nothing could re-run just this step - the only
# repair was the whole install.js, and only with the panel stopped.
#
# WHAT IT DOES
#   * the same five uv commands install.js ran, in the same order (mlx trio +
#     transformers cap, the dependency pass, the --reinstall --no-deps pass that
#     turns the workspace's editable links into real copies, mlx-vlm, the
#     runtime extras);
#   * up to 3 attempts, so a dropped connection is retried, not fatal;
#   * then VERIFIES the result the way the panel judges it
#     (engine_env_check.py: real package directories in site-packages, and an
#     import) - "uv exited 0" is not the question, "can a render start" is;
#   * a lock file (env/.phosphene_engine_install, our pid) for the whole run:
#     the panel reads it to say "still installing" instead of "broken" while a
#     concurrent Install is mid-way, and a second run refuses to start.
#
# PINOKIO SEMANTICS. Pinokio 8.2.0 stops a run when its output matches
# /error:/i or /errno /i, and ignores exit codes. An attempt that will be
# retried must therefore not print uv's own "error:" lines verbatim - they are
# shown with the word defused. The FINAL failure prints "FATAL error:" on
# purpose, so Install stops there instead of downloading 37 GB into a venv that
# cannot render.
#
# Usage: ltx_engine_env.sh [path to the ltx-2-mlx checkout]

# ---- WHY EACH COMMAND ABOVE IS WHAT IT IS ------------------------------------
# Moved verbatim from install.js's inline step (4.17.4), where these notes sat
# beside the commands they explain. The diagnostics echoes became the
# python --version line and engine_env_check.py.
#
# v2.0.3: log Python identity before each pip step. KTDS hit a
# silent missing-package install and we had nothing in the log
# to diagnose it. These echoes leave a paper trail of which
# interpreter is being targeted by --python env/bin/python.
#   (install.js ran: "echo '=== install diagnostics: pip install ==='")
#   (install.js ran: "env/bin/python --version || echo 'venv python NOT executable'")
#   (install.js ran: "env/bin/python -c 'import sys; print(\"sys.executable:\", sys.executable); print(\"sys.path[0]:\", sys.path[0] if sys.path else None)'")
#   (install.js ran: "echo '=== /diagnostics ==='")
# Force the mlx pin BEFORE installing ltx-* packages so their deps
# resolve to the pinned version instead of pulling latest 0.31.x.
#
# SHIP-BLOCKER (2026-07-10, GitHub #40/#38/#37/#33): also pin
# transformers <5.13.0. mlx-lm 0.31.1 declares `transformers>=5.0.0`
# with NO upper bound, so any fresh install after transformers 5.13.0
# dropped (~Jul 9) pulls 5.13.0 — which breaks mlx_lm.tokenizer_utils.
# EVERY generation then crashes with "'str' object has no attribute
# '__module__'": the Gemma text-encoder load silently no-ops ("done in
# 0.0s") → downstream "Model not loaded. Call load() first." Known-good:
# 5.7.0 (our validated build) and 5.12.x. Cap it on the SAME resolve as
# mlx-lm so the constraint sticks. Diagnosed by @saved-j + @xandreau.
#
# The Update path enforces this too — scripts/post_update.sh step 2b,
# a `require` (fatal) step. That sentence used to live here as "uv
# downgrades an already-installed 5.13.0 on the next Update" and was
# simply false for a month: nothing in the update path constrained
# transformers at all, so an existing 5.13.0 survived every Update and
# the install stayed unable to generate anything. A promise about
# another file now names the step that keeps it.
#   (install.js ran: "uv pip install --python env/bin/python 'mlx==0.31.1' 'mlx-lm==0.31.1' 'mlx-metal==0.31.1' 'transformers>=5.0.0,<5.13.0'")
# Y3 — Train Character ships in 3.0. Without ltx-trainer-mlx in
# the venv, the trainer subprocess fails at `import yaml` because
# pyyaml is a transitive dep of ltx-trainer (declared in its
# pyproject). Codex pre-ship review 2026-05-18 caught this.
#
# `--build-constraints ../pip-build-constraints.txt` pins the wheel
# BUILD backend (hatchling<1.32). Upstream's three pyprojects all
# declare `readme = "../../README.md"` — a path outside the package
# dir — which hatchling 1.32.0 turned into a hard error
# ("Readme path must be within the project directory" →
# metadata-generation-failed). uv resolves the build backend fresh
# from PyPI into an isolated env, so from the day 1.32.0 shipped
# this step failed for every NEW install on every pinned tag. See
# pip-build-constraints.txt; update.js runs the same uv command
# (it used to spell it `PIP_CONSTRAINT=`, which modern pip ignores
# by design — one lane now, one failure mode).

# v4.0 — THE SECOND PASS IS THE POINT, and it closes a trap that has
# shipped since the workspace landed. `ltx-2-mlx` is a uv WORKSPACE:
# the line above (with deps, without --reinstall) links its members
# EDITABLE. site-packages gets `_editable_impl_ltx_core_mlx.pth`
# instead of a copy, so `import ltx_core_mlx` resolves to
# `packages/ltx-core-mlx/src/...` — the GIT-TRACKED source. The codec
# patch further down then finds no ltx_core_mlx directory in
# site-packages and patches the tracked file, which is why a
# PERFECTLY SUCCESSFUL install ended with
#     M packages/ltx-core-mlx/src/.../video_vae.py
# every single time — and why the v3.8.0 pin move hit "your local
# changes would be overwritten by checkout" for the whole fleet.
#
# v3.8.1 made the pin move survive that (reset --hard first) and
# v3.8.1's own notes filed this as the follow-up: cure the cause, so
# a FRESH install no longer starts dirty. `--reinstall --no-deps`
# replaces the .pth links with real copies and re-resolves nothing;
# it is the exact command update.js has run for many releases, so
# the end state is one every install already converges to on its
# first Update. One lane, one runtime shape.

# Auto-caption (Gemma 3 12B via mlx-vlm) needs the mlx-vlm
# package. Pinned to 0.4.4 — caption_with_gemma.py's import
# surface (load, generate, prompt_utils.apply_chat_template)
# is stable at that version. --no-deps so we don't drag in
# mlx-vlm's heavy default deps (PIL>=10, av, etc. that fight
# mflux/transformers pins). The runtime imports it lazily so
# a partial install doesn't break the rest of the panel.

# hf_transfer is HuggingFace's Rust-based downloader — 5-10× faster

# The panel sets HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 in download envs; if the
# package is missing the hf CLI falls back gracefully with a warning.
# litellm: agent's chat client (multi-provider router for OpenAI /
# Anthropic / Ollama / mlx-lm.server). Pinned to >=1.83.14 — the
# March 2026 PyPI supply-chain incident affected earlier 1.x
# releases (stole SSH keys via a poisoned post-install script).
# See agent/engine.py for routing details. Falls back to stdlib

#
# smolagents: Phase 2 of the agent-layer refactor. Powers
# the optional CodeAgent runtime in agent/runtime_smol.py,

# floor is bumped to >=1.5.0 to satisfy transformers' pin.
# smolagents itself ships with a pessimistic <1.0 hub pin that
# is empirically benign in practice.
#
# The hub pin range we settle on (>=1.5.0,<2.0) satisfies:
#   - mflux>=0.17.5            wants >=1.1.6,<2.0
