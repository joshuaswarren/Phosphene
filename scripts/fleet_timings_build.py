"""Rebuild data/fleet_timings.json from the fleet's own real wall-clock data.

Owner direction (2026-09-29): "If we have the fleet data, we can provide
proper time estimations, or at least a range." Every estimate in the panel
before this was a MODEL — a per-chip speed factor times a cost function
fitted to a handful of measured renders, all on the maintainer's own Macs.
This script instead asks PostHog what the fleet's OWN installs actually
measured, at three levels of granularity, and the panel's runtime loader
(fleet_estimate_range() in mlx_ltx_panel.py) walks from the most specific
level down to the least specific, falling back to the model only when the
fleet has nothing to say.

WHAT IT QUERIES
    render_completed events, last WINDOW_DAYS days, this project's own
    PostHog (via HogQL — https://posthog.com/docs/hogql). Every field read
    here is documented in docs/ANALYTICS.md; nothing this script computes
    ever leaves a user's machine — the query runs from the MAINTAINER's
    own workstation using the maintainer's own read-only PostHog personal
    API key (the same key the /stats dashboard already uses, resolved the
    same way: Settings -> analytics_query_key in panel_settings.json).

THE OWNER'S OWN INSTALL IS EXCLUDED, by distinct_id (analytics_install_id
in the SAME settings file) — a maintainer boots this panel constantly for
development and testing, and that traffic would otherwise dominate every
"M4 Max 64 GB" cell it appears in.

THREE LEVELS, precomputed here (not reconstructed from each other at
runtime, because quantiles do not combine — re-deriving a coarser
quantile from finer ones would be a second, silently wrong model):
    cell  — engine, mode, tier, frames, chip_family, ram_gb, speed
            (speed only distinguishes anything for H3: <=5 steps is the
            Fast/TriStep lane, per docs/ANALYTICS.md's `steps` field)
    chip  — same, without ram_gb (every RAM class of one chip, pooled)
    model — engine, mode, tier, frames, speed only (every Mac, pooled) —
            the last real-data rung before the panel's own cost model

WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE: render_completed never reports an exact wall clock,
only `wall_sec_bucket` — the LOWER edge of the ladder rung the render fell
in (mlx_ltx_panel.FLEET_WALL_SEC_LADDER). The p25/p50/p75 written here are
quantiles of those lower edges, and the file says so (`"wall_sec":
"bucket_lower_edge"`). The panel's reader (_fleet_cell_seconds) turns them
back into what they support — p25 a rung's lower edge, p50 its middle, p75
its UPPER edge — so a cell whose renders all sit in the 10-15 min rung reads
"~10-15 min", not a tight "~10 min" (4.17 Codex EST-4). Keep the marker in
step with the reader if this script ever stores anything else.

WHAT'S NOT HERE: "same chip+RAM, other length, scaled" is level 2 of the
runtime fallback (VC-01's ledger) — it needs the REQUESTED cell's own
frame count to scale by, which only the running panel knows, so it lives
in fleet_estimate_range() itself, not in this precomputed table.

Run it from the repo root, with the venv that has network access:
    python3 scripts/fleet_timings_build.py

Reads the query key from the REAL install's settings (read-only) — never
prints it, never writes it to the output file, never commits it.
