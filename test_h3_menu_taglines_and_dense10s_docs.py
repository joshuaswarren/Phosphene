"""H3-16 and H3-15 (docs half).

H3-16: the engine-menu taglines didn't help anyone choose. LTX's "every
mode, LoRAs, characters" implied LoRAs (and, next to H3's tagline,
audio) were LTX-exclusive — neither is true: H3 has its own LoRA
library, and LTX 2.3/2.5 already generate audio jointly. Both taglines
now name the capability the other engine might make a user think they'd
lose.

H3-15 (docs half): docs/H3_ENGINE.md said `LTX_H3_DENSE_10S` (unset)
"re-adds" the dense 10 s tier — false. The tier ships `"offered": True"
unconditionally in H3_LENGTHS (mlx_ltx_panel.py) and the env var is not
read anywhere in the codebase. Docs corrected to say so.
